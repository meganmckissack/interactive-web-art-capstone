## Interactive Web Art

### Goal
The goal of this project is to give users a fun experience and a connection to others, collaborating with strangers to create art.  This project also gives me space to explore and experiment with different types of user interactions for the web.

#### MVP features
- users can use their phone's touch screen capabilities to draw/generate art on a website
- multiple users can see each others drawings on the site in real-time
- client and server site hosted and avaible to the public
- artwork will use shader functionlity from three.js/webgl to look painterly

#### Technologies 
- websockets
- react.js
- three.js or react three fiber
- webgl
- node.js
- server hosting, Digtal Ocean(?)

#### Stretch Goals
- sound triggered by user interaction
- collect data from users movements/inputs to generate data visualization

#### Technologies needed for stretch goals
- web audio api
- D3.js
